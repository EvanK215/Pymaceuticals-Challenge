# Pymaceuticals-Challenge
## Intro

Pymaceuticals granted us access to study results for the effectivness of various drug regimine treatments of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer. The study targeted mice from the ages of 1-24 months. 

## Dependencies 

pandas, matlibplot, scipy.stats, numpy

## Resources 
TWO csv with mouse inforamtiona and the other conating the test results

[data\Mouse_metadata.csv]

[data\Study_results.csv]

## Data analysis
The subject data 
Gender split m/f was 50.7%/49.3%
Ages range 1-24 months 
Key Drug regimine focus ('Capomulin', 'Ramicane', 'Infubinol','Ceftamin')

for the key drug Capoumlin and the mouse weight the correlation coefficient is 84 
and returned a slope of y= .95x + 21.55
